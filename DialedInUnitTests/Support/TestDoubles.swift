/// Scaffolding for testing presenters.
///
/// A presenter takes an interactor and a router, both screen-specific protocols that `CoreInteractor`
/// and `CoreRouter` conform to. Neither of those can be built in a test — `CoreRouter` needs a live
/// `AnyRouter` from the view hierarchy — so each screen gets a small double instead.
///
/// `GlobalRouter` only requires one property, `router: AnyRouter`, and SwiftfulRouting publishes a
/// mock one through `RouterEnvironmentKey.defaultValue`. That is what makes this cheap: a router
/// double is its navigation methods recording what they were asked to do, and nothing else.

/// The mock `AnyRouter` the package uses for previews. Navigating through it does nothing.
