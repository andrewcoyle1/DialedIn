// The two helpers that exist because `max(value, floor)` kept being written where a clamp was
// meant. Six crashes of that shape have been fixed in this app, all of them the same: a NaN or an
// infinity survived the floor, reached an `Int(_:)` inside a SwiftUI view body, and trapped while
// the screen was drawing.
//
// These tests are mostly about what the naive spelling gets wrong, so each one states the value
// `max`/`min` alone would have produced.
