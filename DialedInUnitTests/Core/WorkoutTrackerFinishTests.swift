/// The screen dismisses itself before the save is even attempted, which is the whole problem this
/// file guards: there is no router left to alert through, so anything worth saying has to be
/// raised at the app level and outlive the screen that raised it. A workout that fails to save is
/// not lost — the active session is only cleared once the save succeeds, so Training still offers
/// to resume it — but a user who is told nothing has no way to know that.
///
/// Finishing also runs several steps that are not the save: the streak, the rest-day
/// pre-completion, the Strava upload and the Live Activity teardown. None of them may stand
/// between the user and their workout being stored, and none of them may be skipped because
/// another one failed.
