/// The live workout: the screen a user is looking at while they train.
///
/// Three rules here decide what the screen does between sets, and all three are settings-dependent,
/// which is what makes them worth pinning:
///
/// - **Propagate changes.** Correcting the weight on set one copies it onto the sets that still hold
///   the old numbers — but only those, and never onto a set already logged. Copying onto a set the
///   user had deliberately set differently would silently rewrite their session.
/// - **Auto-advance.** Finishing the last set of an exercise moves focus to the next one. On the
///   final exercise there is nowhere to go, so it collapses instead of wrapping round.
/// - **Smart warm-ups.** With the setting off, unlogged warm-ups are stripped and the remaining sets
///   renumbered — but a warm-up the user already did is theirs, and stays.
///
/// The presenter's initialiser reads the active session from the interactor and throws without one,
/// so every test here starts from a session that is already under way.
