//  The workout settings screens.
//
//  All five of these edit one document — every toggle on every one of them writes the whole
//  `WorkoutSettings` back. Each presenter holds its own copy of that document, which is what makes
//  them worth testing: a copy taken when the screen was built goes stale the moment another screen
//  saves, and saving a stale copy does not fail, it quietly reinstates the old values of everything
//  the user changed in between.
//
//  So the questions here are whether a toggle reaches storage at all, and whether flipping one
//  leaves the rest of the document as it was.
//

/// A spy standing in for the settings manager, shared by the screens that only read and write the
/// settings document.
