/// The Previous Reference screen's snapshot of the settings document.
///
/// The screen itself — the two options, the tick, that a choice is saved — is covered in
/// `TrainingSettingsPresenterTests`. What is covered here is the thing those tests cannot see,
/// because they only ever save once: this screen edits a copy of the whole `WorkoutSettings`
/// document and writes the whole thing back, so the copy has to be the current one. Taken at init
/// and never refreshed, it silently reverts whatever another screen saved in the meantime.
