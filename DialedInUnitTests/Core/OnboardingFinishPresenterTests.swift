// The last two screens: connecting Strava, which is optional, and finishing, which is not.
//
// Finishing is the hop out of the onboarding module into the app. Until it happens the user is
// still inside onboarding, so anything that can leave this screen unable to complete strands
// somebody who has already answered every question.

// MARK: - Strava

/// Offered once, near the end. It is worth nothing if a user who does not want it — or whose
/// connection fails — cannot get past it.
