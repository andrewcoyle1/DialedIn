/// The Analytics tab: a card per metric, each summarising the last week and opening a screen of its
/// own.
///
/// Every card has to say something when there is nothing to say, and the empty forms differ — "--"
/// for a missing number, "No Entries" or "No Workouts" for a missing series. A card that showed 0
/// instead would read as a measurement rather than an absence, which is the failure these tests are
/// mostly about.
///
/// The body-metrics figures are served from a cache keyed on a hash of the measurements, so the
/// weight, trend and body-fat cards do not re-sort the whole history on every read. That cache has
/// to notice an edit that leaves the count unchanged — clearing a weight, say — which is pinned
/// here.
