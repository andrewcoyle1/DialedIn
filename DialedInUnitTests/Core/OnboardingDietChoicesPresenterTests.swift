// The four questions the diet plan is built from: which diet, how low calories may go, whether
// the week is flat or varied, and how much protein.
//
// Each screen collects one answer and hands the accumulated answers to the next through a
// delegate. Nothing is stored along the way, so an answer dropped between two screens is an
// answer the finished plan was never built from — and the user has no way to tell.
