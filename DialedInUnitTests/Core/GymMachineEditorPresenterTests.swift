//
//  The machines, and the weight ranges that describe what they can be set to.
//
//  A range is three numbers — a start, an end and the step between them — and it is the only thing
//  the app has to go on when it decides what load a machine can actually be set to. A workout in
//  progress rounds the weight it suggests onto that step, clamped between the start and the end, so
//  every one of these numbers reaches the user as a weight on a bar.
//
//  Unlike the racks, a machine's ranges are listed by name rather than in the order they were
//  added, so these screens sort before they hand positions back to the list.
//

/// A cable machine's ranges.
