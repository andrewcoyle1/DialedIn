/// The Weight Trend screen's presenter, and the pattern for testing any of the others.
///
/// A presenter needs two doubles: its interactor, which is a small protocol listing exactly what
/// the screen reads, and its router, which `GlobalRouter` reduces to one `AnyRouter` property.
/// Both are written below in about thirty lines, which is what each of the remaining screens costs.
///
/// What is worth testing here is the shaping: deleted and weightless entries are filtered out, the
/// readings are smoothed into a trend, and the trend line only appears once there is enough data to
/// draw one.
