// Setting the goal: lose, maintain or gain; a target weight; a weekly rate; and a summary that
// turns the three into a date and saves the goal.
//
// The arithmetic here is small but signed. A target below the current weight is a loss and a
// target above it is a gain, and every downstream calorie target reads the sign off this goal —
// so a target on the wrong side of the objective would quietly tell a user to eat their way to a
// weight they were trying to leave.

/// The signed-in user as the goal screens see them: a weight, and the unit it should be shown in.
