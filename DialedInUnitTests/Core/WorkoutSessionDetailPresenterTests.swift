/// A finished workout, opened to read or to correct.
///
/// Editing is where the rules live. Sets and exercises carry a one-based `index` that positions them
/// in the list, so removing one has to renumber what is left — otherwise the gap persists and the
/// next set added lands on a number already taken. Adding a set copies the previous set's numbers,
/// because a user adding a fourth set of the same thing should not retype it.
///
/// The summary figures exclude warm-ups, as they do on the Workouts screen: counting them would
/// reward a longer ramp as if it were more training.
