//
//  Adding one more weight to a piece of equipment a gym already has.
//
//  Seven screens, one shape: a blank entry is prepared in the unit the list was showing, the user
//  sets a figure on it, and saving appends it to the equipment. What a gym holds is not a cosmetic
//  list — a live workout rounds the weight it suggests onto the nearest thing the gym actually has,
//  so a weight added here in the wrong unit, or added twice, changes the load someone is told to
//  lift.
//
//  A refused save shows an alert through `showSimpleAlert`, a `GlobalRouter` extension method that
//  none of these router protocols restate, so it dispatches statically past any double. Each
//  refusal is asserted as "the equipment did not gain a weight" instead, which is the part the user
//  would feel, and each acceptance as "it did". The same goes for the `dismissScreen` that follows
//  a successful save.
