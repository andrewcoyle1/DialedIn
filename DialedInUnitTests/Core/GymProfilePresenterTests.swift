/// The gym profile: which equipment a gym has, across eleven kinds of it.
///
/// The screen shows each kind as a searchable, filterable list, and every row is editable in place.
/// That is the awkward part: the rows are sorted by name but the bindings have to write back to the
/// item's position in the *unsorted* array. Handing a row the binding for its display position
/// instead would let a user edit one dumbbell and change another, which is why the write-back is
/// pinned here rather than left to the view.
///
/// A profile with no name cannot be saved, so leaving the screen asks before discarding it.
