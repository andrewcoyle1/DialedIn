/// The paywall: the one screen where the app takes money, and the one gate between a free user and
/// the rest of the product.
///
/// Two failures matter more than everything else here and both are silent. A paywall that stays up
/// after a successful purchase charges someone and gives them nothing — so every path that ends in
/// money changing hands must move the user on. And a paywall that moves the user on without an
/// active entitlement gives the product away — so "the call returned without throwing" is never
/// enough; the entitlement has to be checked. Both directions are pinned below.
///
/// `dismissEnvironment()` and `dismissScreen()` are `GlobalRouter` extensions, statically
/// dispatched, so a double never sees them. Off onboarding, a successful purchase dismisses the
/// paywall that way and there is nothing to observe — those tests assert that the onboarding
/// routing did *not* happen instead, which is the mistake that would actually hurt.
