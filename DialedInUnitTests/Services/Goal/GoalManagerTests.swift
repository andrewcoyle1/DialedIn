/// The user's single weight goal.
///
/// `WeightGoal.id` is the user id, so there is exactly one goal per account and saving is always
/// an overwrite. Everything the app shows about progress — the target, the weekly rate, whether
/// the goal is still running — comes off `currentGoal`, which is nil until the document listener
/// has emitted.
///
/// The four status transitions send a field update rather than a whole document, and
/// `MockRemoteDocumentService.updateDocument` re-yields the stored document without applying the
/// fields. So a test can prove a transition reached the store and can prove the guard paths, but
/// cannot observe `status` changing; that needs a fake that applies writes, which would mean
/// importing SwiftfulDataManagers into the test target. The transition tests below say only what
/// they can actually check.
