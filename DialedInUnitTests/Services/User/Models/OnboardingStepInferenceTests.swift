/// Where onboarding resumes, worked out from the stored profile rather than a saved cursor.
///
/// This is what decides the screen a returning user lands on after quitting part-way through, and
/// it is derived: there is no "last step" field to go stale, only the profile itself. That makes
/// the order of the guards the whole behaviour — get one wrong and a user is either sent back
/// through a step they finished or dropped past one they never did.
///
/// `OnboardingStepRouter` switches on exactly this value, so it is also the list of screens that
/// must stay reachable.
