/// The gyms the user trains at, and the equipment each one has.
///
/// Every exercise the app offers during a workout is filtered by the active gym's equipment, so a
/// profile that loses its equipment lists silently narrows what the user can log. `GymProfileSyncTests`
/// covers loading, saving, reading by id and deleting; this suite covers what that one leaves —
/// the session boundary, the failure paths, the equipment payload and the stored form.
///
/// `saveGymProfile(profile:image:)` builds a `FirebaseImageUploadService` inline, so only the
/// `image: nil` path is reachable from a unit test. Every save here passes nil.
