/// The exercises the app ships with, and the hand-written ones behind `userMocks`.
///
/// `ExerciseModel.mocks` is no longer a hand-written array: it is `PrebuiltExercises.json`, the
/// same file the app seeds a new account from. That makes these tests worth more than they were —
/// a malformed or renamed field in that JSON leaves `PrebuiltSeedData.exercises` empty and a new
/// user with no exercise library at all, which nothing else would catch.
///
/// The `eventParameters` tests that lived here went with `ExerciseModelModel`, which had one; so
/// did a run of edge cases asserting that a `String` property holds long, unicode or empty strings.
