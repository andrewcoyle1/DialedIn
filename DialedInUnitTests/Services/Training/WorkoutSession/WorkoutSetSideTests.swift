/// A single-arm row is logged as two rows per set, because each arm lifts its own weight for its
/// own reps — but the user did one set, and a screen that says otherwise is telling them they have
/// done twice the work they have. Everything here defends that one rule: sides are told apart by
/// `side`, never by position or index; a left and a right count as one set everywhere a set count
/// is shown; and volume is the deliberate exception, because both arms really did lift.
