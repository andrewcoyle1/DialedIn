/// Seeding the shipped workout library.
///
/// The prebuilt workouts are stored as exercise *ids*, so a workout can only be built once the
/// exercise library exists — which is why `CoreInteractor.logIn()` seeds exercises first and
/// hands the result to this manager. Seeding is then gated on two `UserDefaults` flags, and
/// those flags are the dangerous part: once they say "done", the library is never rebuilt until
/// the version is bumped.
///
/// Each test gets `UserDefaults` of its own rather than `.standard`, so the flags here cannot
/// collide with the developer-menu tests, which assert on the same four literal keys.
