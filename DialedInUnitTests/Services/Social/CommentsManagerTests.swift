/// Comments on a workout session.
///
/// The manager is a pass-through over `CommentsManagerService`, so what is worth pinning down is
/// the contract the comments screen is written against: a fetch is scoped to one session, deleted
/// comments never come back, and every call surfaces its error rather than returning an empty list
/// that the screen would render as "no comments yet".
///
/// There is no in-memory collection here and no listener — each fetch is a round trip — so nothing
/// in this suite needs `eventually`.
