/// No `HKWorkoutSession` can be started in a test process, so everything here is the half of the
/// manager that does not need one: the rest timer, the shared storage it writes for the widget, and
/// the announcement the tracker screen listens for. `state` therefore stays `.notStarted`
/// throughout, which the manager reports as active: only a paused HealthKit session reads as not.
///
/// Serialized because the three things under test — `NotificationCenter.default`, the app group's
/// `UserDefaults`, and the process-wide dispatch queues the rest timer fires on — are all shared,
/// and two of these tests running at once would read each other's posts.
