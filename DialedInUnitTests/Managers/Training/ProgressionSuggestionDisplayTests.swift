/// What the tracker's Auto column shows, and which suggestion each row of it belongs to.
///
/// The column used to compute its own number from the previous set's estimated 1RM, which could
/// disagree with the engine that had already filled the row in. Now it reads the engine's own
/// suggestion, so the two things worth pinning down are the mapping — a row to its suggested set —
/// and the label, which has to read the same way the Prev column does in every tracking mode.
