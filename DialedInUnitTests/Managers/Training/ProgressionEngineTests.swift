/// Double progression, in the only place it is decided.

/// The engine is a pure function of its input — no gym, no managers, no clock — so every case
/// here is the algorithm itself rather than a screen exercising it. What it has to get right:
///
/// - **Reaching the top of the range earns weight**, and adding weight drops the reps back to the
///   bottom of it. Which set has to reach the top is the difference between the two adjustment
///   modes: weight-first takes one, reps-first wants them all.
/// - **A miss holds, two misses deload.** One bad session is a bad day; the second one in a row,
///   at the same weight or heavier, is the signal.
/// - **Effort overrides the rep count.** A set that hit the top of the range at an RPE harder
///   than it was prescribed did not earn weight.
/// - **Rounding is the gym's, not the algorithm's.** Where the rounding swallows the increment
///   whole, the engine adds a second one rather than suggesting the weight just lifted.
