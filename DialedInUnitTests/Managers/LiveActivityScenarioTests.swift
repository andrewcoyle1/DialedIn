//  A whole workout driven the way a user drives it from the Lock Screen: tap what the activity
//  shows, and after every tap check what the activity would show next. The widget is a pure
//  function of the content state (`LiveActivityPhase`), so asserting the phase after each push is
//  asserting what the user sees, without SpringBoard in the loop.
//
//  The two bugs this exists for were both in this loop: a completion the app never consumed, and a
//  push that pointed at a finished exercise and left the banner with no target and no way out.
