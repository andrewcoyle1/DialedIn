//
//  What a weight is allowed to be, as plain numbers.
//
//  `WorkoutSessionModel`'s rounding needs a gym profile and so is `@MainActor`; the progression
//  engine is neither and must stay that way. Resolving the equipment once, on the main actor,
//  and handing the engine the four numbers that fall out of it keeps the rule in one place
//  without dragging the gym into the algorithm.
