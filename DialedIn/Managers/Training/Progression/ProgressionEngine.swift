//  Double progression: work up the rep range at a weight, then add weight and drop back to the
//  bottom of the range. The engine is pure — no managers, no `@MainActor`, no `Date()` — so the
//  whole of it can be tested in milliseconds. Rounding to what the gym can actually load arrives
//  as a closure, because the equipment lives on the other side of a manager and the rule does not.
