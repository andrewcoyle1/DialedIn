//  How long the rest after a set is, in one place.
//
//  Two callers need the same answer: `SetTrackerRowPresenter`, when the user logs a set on the
//  tracker, and `LiveActivityIntentHandler`, when they log it from the Live Activity instead. A
//  rest that differed between the two would be the same workout resting for two different lengths
//  depending on which button was pressed, so the decision lives here and both call it.
//
//  Pure: everything it needs is passed in, so it can be exercised without a presenter, an
//  interactor or a manager.
