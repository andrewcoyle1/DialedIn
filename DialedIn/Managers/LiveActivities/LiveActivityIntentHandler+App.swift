//
//  LiveActivityIntentHandler+App.swift
//  DialedIn
//
//  The app's implementation of `LiveActivityIntentHandling`
//  (spec: docs/specs/live-activity.md §7.1).
//
//  A `LiveActivityIntent` runs in this process, so the button on the Live Activity can do the
//  work here and now rather than leaving a note in the app group for something to poll. The v1
//  hand-off did poll, from a timer that only started once HealthKit's `beginCollection` had
//  succeeded — which is why Complete Set advanced the widget and logged nothing on a phone where
//  HealthKit was declined.
//
//  Every action finishes by pushing the saved session to the activity, so the app is the single
//  source of truth for what the activity shows.
//
