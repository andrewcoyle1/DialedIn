    /// from `"nan"` or an overflowing multiplication — and roughly fifteen screens print nutrients
    /// through `Int(_:)`, which traps rather than printing something odd, inside a view body. See
    /// `Double+EXT.swift` for the class.

    /// Such a value is **dropped rather than stored as zero**, for the same reason an unknown key
    /// is dropped: absent already means "this food's data does not record it", which is exactly
    /// what a corrupt figure amounts to, while zero would assert the food contains none of the
    /// nutrient. Breakdowns lean on that distinction — `recordedKeys(in:)` lists only what is
    /// really there, and `AddMealPresenter.breakdown(for:)` deliberately omits rather than prints
    /// `0 mcg`. The headline macros read through `?? 0`, so they are unaffected either way.
