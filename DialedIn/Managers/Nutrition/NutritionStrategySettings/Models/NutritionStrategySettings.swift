/// The expenditure fields are read by `ExpenditureEngine`: `calculationMode`,
/// `calculationStartDate`, `algorithmVersion` and `stepInformedUpdates` shape the estimate, and
/// `predictiveGoalAdjustments` shapes the `TargetProposal` built on it. `estimationMethod` and
/// `bmrEquation` still shape the prior through `resolvedBMREquation`. The strategy fields above
/// them — the check-in cadence, partial logging, fasting and logging breaks — drive the weekly
/// check-in: `CheckInSchedule` reads `checkInWeekday`, and `CheckInPresenter` builds its step
/// list from the other five. See `docs/specs/adaptive-expenditure.md` and
/// `docs/specs/weekly-check-in.md`.
