/// A short message shown over whatever the user happens to be looking at.
///
/// Raised through `NotificationCenter` rather than a router, because the thing worth saying is
/// often decided after the screen that decided it has gone: the workout tracker dismisses itself
/// before its save finishes, and the result of that save still has to reach the user.
///
/// Re-raising under the same `id` replaces the message in place, which is how one piece of work
/// reports its own progress — "retrying" becoming "saved" is one toast changing its mind, not two.
