# Smart progression — algorithm spec (v1)

Status: specification for implementation. Written 2026-09-22. Gives meaning to the three
`WorkoutSettings` fields the dead-settings audit lists as `feature`:
`smartProgressionInitialLogFill`, `smartProgressionAdjustmentMode`,
`smartProgressionApplyInSession`.

## 1. Purpose

Suggest the weight, reps, duration or distance for each working set of an exercise at the start
of a session, from what the user did last time and the template's rep targets, using
**double progression**: work up the rep range at a weight, then add weight and drop back to the
bottom of the range. Optionally re-suggest the remaining sets of an exercise live, after each
set is completed.

The engine is **pure**: a value-type `ProgressionEngine` in
`DialedIn/Managers/Training/Progression/` with no manager dependencies, no `@MainActor`, no
`Date()`. Rounding to gym equipment stays where it is (`WorkoutSessionModel.roundWeightToEquipmentIncrement`); the engine takes a rounding closure so it does not
need the gym profile.

## 2. Inputs

```
struct ProgressionInput {
    let trackingMode: TrackingMode                 // .weightReps, .repsOnly, .timeOnly, .distanceTime
    let setTargets: [SetTarget]                    // from the template's WorkoutExerciseModel
    let history: [ProgressionHistorySession]       // most recent first, at most 3, see §2.1
    let adjustmentMode: ProgressionAdjustmentMode  // .weightFirst / .repsFirst
    let roundWeight: (Double) -> Double            // kg in, kg rounded to equipment/unit out
    let minimumIncrementKg: Double                 // smallest step the rounding can express; see §2.2
}

struct ProgressionHistorySession {
    let workingSets: [WorkoutSetModel]             // completed, non-warm-up, in index order
}
```

### 2.1 History

History is resolved per exercise by `CoreInteractor.previousSessions(forExerciseTemplateId:workoutTemplateId:authorId:trainingProgramId:limit:)`, the single place `previousWorkoutReference`
is honoured — the tracker's "Prev" column goes through the same call, so Auto and Prev can never
disagree about what last time was. Its three scopes are `.anyExercise` (the last sessions that
included this exercise, whatever workout they were, via
`getLastCompletedSessionsContainingExercise(...)`), `.sameWorkout` (the last completed sessions of
this workout template, in any program — the default) and `.workoutsInProgram` (the same, filtered
by `trainingProgramId`). The two template scopes fall back to the any-exercise lookup when this
template holds no history for the exercise, so an exercise new to a template still progresses from
wherever it was last performed. The lookup returns the last **three** completed sessions
(`limit: 3`), because the deload rule in §3.4 needs to see two consecutive misses. The exercise's history is the sets of the
exercise with the same `templateId` in each of those sessions, filtered to
`isWarmup == false && completedAt != nil`. Sessions where the exercise has no completed working
set are dropped from the history. Per-side exercises: the two rows of a set are one set; use the
row with `side == .left` (or the first row) as the set's values.

### 2.2 Rep range and increment

For target set `i` (1-based `setNumber`), `minReps`/`maxReps` come from `setTargets[i]`. When
either is nil, derive from the reference set (§3.1): `minReps = prevReps`, `maxReps = prevReps + 2`. When the template has fewer targets than the previous session had sets, the last target
applies to the extra sets.

`minimumIncrementKg`: the caller passes the equipment's increment when the exercise is on a
pin-loaded or cable machine, else 2.5 kg when the preferred unit is kg and 5 lb (2.268 kg) when
it is lb. The engine adds at least one `minimumIncrementKg` and then rounds through
`roundWeight`; if rounding brings the weight back to the previous value it adds a second
increment and rounds again.

Only sets whose `setType` is `.standard` or `.failure` are progressed. `.drop` and `.myo` sets
are prefilled with previous values (never progressed) so the intensity technique stays what the
template author designed.

## 3. Algorithm (session-start suggestion)

### 3.1 Reference

`ref = history[0]` (the most recent session with completed working sets). Reference set for
target `i` is `ref.workingSets[i]` if it exists, else the last working set of `ref`.

No history → `rationale = .noHistory`; suggestions are nil for every field, and the caller falls
back to the existing behaviour (template defaults). The engine never invents a starting weight.

### 3.2 Classification (per exercise, weight/reps mode)

Let `top` be the number of working sets in `ref` that reached `maxReps` (reps ≥ maxReps) and
`missed` the number that fell below `minReps`. Let `rpeOK` be true unless a set has `rpe`
logged **and** the target has `rirTarget` **and** `rpe > 10 − rirTarget + 0.5` (the set was
harder than prescribed; RPE and RIR are the same scale from opposite ends).

| Condition | Class |
|---|---|
| `missed > 0` and the previous session (`history[1]`) also had `missed > 0` at a weight ≥ this one | `.deload` |
| `missed > 0` | `.hold` |
| `.weightFirst` and `top × 2 > workingSets.count` (a majority) and `rpeOK` | `.progressWeight` |
| `.repsFirst` and `top == workingSets.count` and `rpeOK` | `.progressWeight` |
| otherwise | `.addReps` |

### 3.3 Suggestion per class (weight/reps)

- `.progressWeight`: every progressable set gets `weight = roundUp(refWeight + minimumIncrementKg)` (§2.2) and `reps = minReps`.
- `.addReps`: each set keeps `refWeight`; `reps = min(refReps + 1, maxReps)`. A set that was
  already at `maxReps` keeps `maxReps` (in `.repsFirst` this is the set waiting for the others).
- `.hold`: every set keeps `refWeight` and `refReps` exactly. One miss is a bad day, not a signal.
- `.deload`: `weight = roundWeight(refWeight × 0.90)` (rounding down if the rounding is
  ambiguous), `reps = minReps`.

Reference weight is per set: set `i` progresses from its own `ref` set, so a session logged with
descending weights stays descending.

### 3.4 Other tracking modes

- `.repsOnly` (bodyweight): classification as §3.2 with `top`/`missed` on reps; `.progressWeight`
  becomes **raise the range**: `reps = maxReps + 1` on every set (and the caller shows the target
  range shifted by one). `.addReps`, `.hold` as above. `.deload`: `reps = minReps`.
- `.timeOnly`: the reference value is `durationSec`. No rep range: suggest
  `duration = roundTo5s(refDuration × 1.10)` when every set was completed, else hold.
- `.distanceTime`: reference `distanceMeters`; suggest `roundTo50m(refDistance × 1.05)` when every
  set was completed, else hold; `durationSec` carried over unchanged.

### 3.5 Output

```
struct ProgressionSuggestion: Equatable {
    let rationale: Rationale                // .noHistory, .progressWeight, .addReps, .hold, .deload
    let sets: [SuggestedSet]                // one per target set, index-aligned with the working sets
}
struct SuggestedSet: Equatable {
    let weightKg: Double?
    let reps: Int?
    let durationSec: Int?
    let distanceMeters: Double?
}
extension ProgressionSuggestion.Rationale {
    var hint: String   // "Add weight", "Add a rep", "Repeat last session", "Lighter this week", ""
}
```

## 4. Live in-session adjustment (`smartProgressionApplyInSession`)

Per product decision this toggle means **live set-to-set re-suggestion**. When it is on, after a
working set is completed (`SetTrackerRowPresenter.onSetComplete`), the engine's
`adjustRemaining(completed: WorkoutSetModel, target: SetTarget, remaining: [WorkoutSetModel], mode: TrackingMode, roundWeight:, minimumIncrementKg:) -> [SuggestedSet?]` runs over the
**not-yet-completed** sets of that exercise:

| Completed set | Remaining sets |
|---|---|
| reps < minReps − 1 (missed by two or more) | weight × 0.95 rounded, reps = minReps |
| reps == minReps − 1 (missed by one) | same weight, reps = minReps |
| reps ≥ maxReps + 2 and (rpe logged ≤ 8 or no rpe) | weight + one increment, reps = minReps |
| otherwise | nil (no change) |

Weight/reps mode only in v1; other modes return all-nil.

**Never overwrite what the user typed.** A remaining set is only rewritten when its current
values still equal the engine's last suggestion for that set (the presenter keeps the
session-start `ProgressionSuggestion` per exercise and updates it as it applies live changes).
A set the user has edited is left alone and the hint shows the suggestion instead.

When the toggle is off, nothing runs after set completion.

## 5. `smartProgressionInitialLogFill`

In `WorkoutSessionModel.init(template:previousWorkoutSession:…)` the prefill block currently
implements `.previousValues` unconditionally (and its comment says so). Add a
`prefill: SessionPrefill` parameter:

```
enum SessionPrefill {
    case previousValues                        // today's behaviour, unchanged
    case empty                                 // working sets keep nil weight/reps/duration/distance
    case suggestions([String: ProgressionSuggestion])   // by exercise templateId
}
```

The presenter maps the setting to the case: `.previousValues` → `.previousValues`; `.empty` →
`.empty`; `.smartProgression` → runs the engine per exercise and passes `.suggestions`; an
exercise with `.noHistory` falls back to `.previousValues` for that exercise (which yields
nothing too, and then the template defaults apply). Warm-up generation keeps using the first
working set's values, so warm-ups follow the suggestion automatically.

## 6. Integration points

1. `WorkoutSessionManager.getLastCompletedSessionsForTemplate(templateId:authorId:inTrainingProgramId:limit:)` — new, sorted most recent first; the existing single-session function becomes `limit: 1`.
1. `WorkoutSessionManager.getLastCompletedSessionsContainingExercise(exerciseTemplateId:authorId:inTrainingProgramId:limit:)` — the any-exercise lookup the `.anyExercise` scope and the fallback use.
2. `WorkoutTrackerPresenter`: holds `progressionSuggestions: [String: ProgressionSuggestion]`;
   builds the session with the right `SessionPrefill`; exposes
   `progressionHint(for exerciseId:) -> String?` for the exercise header.
3. `SetTrackerRowPresenter.onSetComplete`: when `workoutSettings.smartProgressionApplyInSession`,
   call the presenter's `applyLiveProgression(after:in:)`.
4. Exercise tracker header: a one-line hint from the rationale (e.g. "Smart Progression: add
   weight"), hidden when `.noHistory`. No new screens.
5. `SmartProgressionSettingsPresenter`: no change; the three controls already save.

## 7. Test cases (`DialedInUnitTests/Managers/Training/ProgressionEngineTests.swift`)

Helpers: `sets(_ pairs: [(kg: Double, reps: Int, rpe: Double?)])`, `targets(min:max:count:rir:)`,
`roundToHalfKg`, `minimumIncrementKg: 2.5`. Weight/reps unless stated.

1. **No history** → `.noHistory`, every field nil.
2. **Weight-first, top set hit max**: targets 8–12 ×3, ref 60 kg × (12, 10, 9) → `.progressWeight`,
   all sets 62.5 kg × 8.
3. **Reps-first, same data** → `.addReps`: 60 × (12, 11, 10).
4. **Reps-first, all at max** → `.progressWeight` 62.5 × 8 ×3.
5. **Hold on one miss**: ref 60 × (12, 8, 6) with min 8 → `.hold`, values identical to ref.
6. **Deload on two misses**: history[0] 60 × (7, 7, 6), history[1] 60 × (7, 6, 6) → `.deload`,
   54 kg (60 × 0.9 rounded to 0.5) × 8.
7. **Second miss at a lighter weight is not a deload**: history[1] at 55 kg with misses → `.hold`.
8. **RPE gate**: weight-first, top hit but rpe 9.5 with rirTarget 2 (limit 8.5) → `.addReps`.
9. **Missing rep range**: no targets, ref 60 × 10 → range 10–12; `.addReps` → 60 × 11.
10. **Rounding that lands on the same weight adds a second increment**: rounding to 5 kg,
    ref 60, increment 2.5 → 65.
11. **Per-set reference**: ref 100 × 12, 90 × 12, 80 × 12 weight-first → 102.5, 92.5, 82.5.
12. **Drop set untouched**: target 3 is `.drop`; under `.progressWeight` sets 1–2 progress and
    set 3 keeps ref values.
13. **Fewer targets than sets**: 2 targets, 3 ref sets → third set uses target 2's range.
14. **Reps-only raise the range**: targets 8–12, ref (12, 12, 12) → `.progressWeight`, reps 13.
15. **Time**: ref 60 s all completed → 66 s (rounded to 5 s → 65). One incomplete → hold.
16. **Distance**: ref 1000 m → 1050 m.
17. **Live: missed by two** (min 8, did 6 at 60) → remaining 57 kg (60 × 0.95 = 57, rounded to 0.5) × 8.
18. **Live: missed by one** → 60 × 8.
19. **Live: beat max by two, rpe 7** → 62.5 × 8. Same with rpe 9 → nil.
20. **Live: user-edited set is not overwritten** (presenter-level test in
    `WorkoutTrackerPresenterProgressionTests`): set 2 edited to 55 kg before set 1 completes with
    a miss → set 2 stays 55, set 3 changes.
21. **Prefill `.empty`** (`WorkoutSessionModel` test): working sets have nil weight and reps even
    with a previous session.
22. **Prefill `.suggestions`**: the session's working sets equal the suggestion, warm-ups derive
    from the suggested first set.

## 8. Out of scope for v1

Periodisation across weeks, autoregulation from RPE trends, estimated 1RM, per-exercise
overrides of the increment, and any change to the Smart Progression settings screen.
